#PodcastChapters

This small utility app helps you to track chapters in the podcast you are listening to. It hooks into iTunes and if the playing podcast has embedded chapter information then it will be shown in the dropdown window. The artwork and the title is used from the chapter metadata. 

You might wonder why this app exists. Well I am listening to podcasts made by DJs like:

* Laidback Luke (*Mixmash Radio*)
* R3hab (*I Need R3hab*)
* Dannic (*Front Of House Radio*)
* ...

It is not really convinient to access the chapter info in iTunes. This app helps to make this easier and faster.

##Demo

##Usage

Clone the repo and run the `PodcastChapters` scheme.

##Requirements

The app is built for El Capitan (OSX 10.11) because it is using the new NSCollectionView APIs. Probably it is not compatible with older OSX versions.
